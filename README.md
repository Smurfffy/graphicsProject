This is my Graphics project canvas game.

The objective of the game is to collect items with the User Square. The more items you collect the bigger the controlled square and the items becomes making the game easier with the more you collect. A score is added and displayed to you after 30 seconds of the game.

The overall goal of the game is to collect as many items as you can in 30 seconds. After 30 seconds the game is over and you must refresh the page to try again.

Your square (the read sqaure) is controlled by the directional keys on the keyboard. (Up, Down, Left, Right).

The green sqaures are the items you have to try and collect, they move as soon as they are collected. The more you collect the higher the score.

GOOD LUCK!
